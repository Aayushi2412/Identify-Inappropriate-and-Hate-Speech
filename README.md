# Identify-Inappropriate-and-Hate-Speech
People spend a lot of time on social media, with this comes into light, a great issue of people using offensive language and hate words on these social platforms about one other. The use of such languages leads to discomfort, anxiety, and many other mental disorders as well. So, in our project we intend to solve this issue to some extent. 

## Existing solution and its limitation
The accuracy of detecting fake news using Naive Bayes algorithm , was only 67.33% .Therefore some articles are predicted as false.
Also for datasets containing large values, the time complexity increased. The model took longer than usual time for calculation.

## Proposed Solution
# Hate Speech Recognition using Decision Tree Classifier

To achieve the hate speech predictor, we aim to employ the following steps: -
1. Create a simple machine learning model i.e. Decision Tree
2. Gather a small twitter data set containing “English Language” as their script.
3. train the model to recognise language and predict further features using Natural Language Processing.
4. Carry out learning algorithms to train the model for better accuracy.
5. Testing and predicting languages consistently.
6. Rectify errors

## Functionality of proposed solution
The proposed solution provides output in 3 formats :-
1. Hate Speech
2. Offensive language
3. Neither
